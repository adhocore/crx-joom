## what

`joom` is a chrome web browser extension that zooms in webpage as soon as it loads


## why

- some webpages have so much small font that really stresses upon eye
- automatically zoom in upto 1.15x by default (change zval in zoom.js to your taste)
	- (this will be configurable option in later version of the extension)
- get rid of `ctrl plus` or `ctrl + mousewheel` for zoom everytime a new page loads
- read large texts clearly without eye-strain


## how

- clone or [download](https://github.com/adhocore/crx-joom/archive/master.zip) this repo to your machine
- unzip as the folder `crx-joom-master`
- open up your Google chrome browser and type `chrome://extensions/` at Address bar
    - or go to Chrome Settings > Extensions
- check/select the `Developer Mode` checkbox on top
- then click `Load unpacked extension` and browse file system and the select `crx-joom-master` folder recently unzipped


## next?

- add setting for default and website specific zoom level


## shit

- just visit [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and remove it


## changelog 

### 2014-05-20

- added the configurable option for current page and all pages
	- (known issue: the live zoom breaks rarely during the configuration)
